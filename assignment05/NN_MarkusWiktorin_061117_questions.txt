Q: Why will the method of steepest descent not always find the optimal solution?
A: It can get stuck in local minima.
Q: Why can't the method of steepest descent be applied to any function?
A: The function needs to be contnuously differentiable.
Q: How is Newton's method different from steepest descent?
A: It takes the second derivative instead of the first.

Q: What are the three basic elements of the neuronal model?
A: A set of synapses or connecting links, an adder, an activation function

Q: What is the difference between synaptic links and activation links?
A: synaptic links provide a linear input-output relation whereas activation links are governed by a non-linear input-output relation.

Q: How does the bias affect the neural network?
A: The bias increases or lowers the net input of the activation function.

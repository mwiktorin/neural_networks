Q: What does the k-mean algorithmen give?
A: The centers of the points.
Q: What is the advantage of casting a complex pattern-classification problem in a high-dimensional space nonlinearly?
A: It is more likely linearly separable than in a low-dimensional space.
Q: Where do we find the radial-basis functions in the NN?
A: In the hidden layer.
